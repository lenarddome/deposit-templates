- What is important is `Chekhov's Gun`.
- Each section must have three clearly identifiable stages that drives the plot of ideas and links them together (paragraph to paragraph):
    1. **Opening** with a problem, phenomenon that result or follows from the previous line of **observations**, reasoning in the above paragraph; and the explanation of that problem both empirically and theoretically
    2. **Challenge** `Build tension` by easing in the counter-example or/and data that challenges the explanation/model/account-of-the-phenomenon you introduced
    3. **Action**, i.e. analyze the data critically, take another look at the technical details of the method/confounds, etc. before you conclude
    4. Give a **Resolution**, by showing how our understanding on the problem/nature/phenomenon advanced by gaining insight into the problem identified
